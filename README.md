Vessel Notes
=========

Notes for each vessel, available both in the VAB and in flight

Description

This mod is designed to let you enter notes and keep logs for each vessel.  Notes can be entered in the editor (VAB/SPH) and will carry over into flight.  

When in flight, you can keep notes and a log of the vessel.  When a vessel is recovered, the logs will be written out to files in the save directory of the game, in a directory called VesselLogs

This mod is added to every part with a ModuleCommand (ie:  pods, etc), but NOT the external seat.

Notes
Multiple notes can be added.  Notes added to one part will be shared/copied to all the other parts with the ModuleCommand module.  To keep a note private to a specific part, enable the Private flag.  Be warned, that once a note is marked Private it cannot be re-shared again; if you want to do that you will need to delete the note and add it again.  Notes can be deleted

Activation
The mod is available in the PAW (Part Action Window), and is called "Vessel Notes & Logs"

Logs
Log entries are generated based on the current vessel situation.  Beyond that, the log entries cannot be deleted, although they can be edited at will.  Log entries are shared with all parts on the vessel with ModuleCommand.

Docking
When two vessels dock, their individual notes and log entries will be preserved.  New entries will be shared, but the older ones will not.  When undocking, the same goes
